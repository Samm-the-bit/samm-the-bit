Ingredients:
(There should be a roughly even amount of each veggie)
(I do not measure the spices. You should add as much as your soul asks of you.)

1 carton veggie broth
1 tbsp tomato paste
5 cloves of garlic, minced
1/2 inch of ginger, minced
1 tsp ground black pepper
1/2 tsp ground cinnamon
1 tbsp ground cumin
1 tsp ground paprika
1/2 tsp cardamom
1/2 tsp ground cloves
1 tsp chili powder (add more for spice preference)
1 tsp tumeric
2 bay leaves
1 tbsp chicken-less better than bouillon (optional)
1 diced sweet onion
2-3 cups cubed butternut squash
2 chopped zucchini
2 cubed potatoes
2 diced carrots
2 cans of cannolini, butter, or pinto beans (drained)
1 can diced tomatoes
1 cup uncooked pearled barley
Salt
olive oil or any other neutral oil


Begin heating about a tbsp of oil in a large pot, then add in the diced onion with a pinch of salt to help draw out the moisture. When the onion is translucent, add the garlic and ginger and cook until the onion begins to caramelize (the edges are nice and brown). Now make a little well in the onion to add the tomato paste. This will let it caramelize a bit. Add all the spices on top of the onion. They should become fragrant. After about 2-3 minutes, mix everything together. Add the bouillon if you have it.
Add the butternut squash, potatoes, zucchini, and carrots. I have also been known to add green beans at this step. Mix and let sauté for about 5 minutes. Now add the beans and canned tomatoes (with liquid). Let it cook for another few minutes until everything is more combined. Add the box of broth with the barley and mix
Taste and add salt and more spices as desired. Cook for about an hour or until the barley is cooked. You may have to add more water during this step, so be sure to check every once in a while.
Stew is stewed. Top with cheese and or nutritional yeast and eat. Can be frozen or stored in the fridge until you realize it&rsquo;s been in there for too long.
