<!-- Howdy, my main interests are... my hobbies are...-->
# Howdy!
I'm Sam Ward, an undergraduate math major at UT Austin. I am currently enjoying studying Algebraic Geometry and Algebraic Topology. I am currently not enjoying studying for the GRE and Math GRE. (I graduate spring 2026). 

Outside of Math, I enjoy hobbies such as hiking, reading Sci-fi/general fiction, taking pictures of my cat, Hilbert, and drinking teas that are substantially caffeinated.
