This is *loosely* based off shoyu ramen, which is made with a light, soy sauce-based broth. Gronion means green onion or spring onion. 

For the gronion oil:
* 2 green onions, cut into long strips, but separate the green from the white
* 1 garlic clove, sliced thin
* pinch of salt
* red chili flakes (optional)
* 2-3 tbsp neutral oil (I use avocado)

For the broth:
* 1 small piece of kombu seaweed - rinsed and soaked overnight
* 1 tbsp of better than bouillon no-chicken broth (optional)
* 3 cups of veggie broth
* 1 tbsp soy sauce
* 1 dollop of honey or agave (to taste)
* 1 - 2 cracks of black pepper
* 1 pinch msg
* 1/2 tsp tomato paste
* 1 shake garlic powder
* 4-5 shiitake mushrooms
* 1 shake onion powder

Stuff to put in the broth:
* soft-boiled eggs
* fresh ramen noodles, cooked (or dried)
* cubed firm tofu
* steamed corn
* sesame seeds
* Sautéed Oyster mushrooms/shiitake/enoki/button (what have you)
* Whatever else you want


1. Start the broth by adding the veggie broth to a pot and bringing it to a simmer. Add the kombu and let simmer for about 10 minutes. Remove the kombu and add all the rest of the ingredients. Mix and let simmer while you prepare whatever you wish to add (noodles, corn, whatever else).  
2. In a small pot or pan, add oil until sizzling hot. Add the whites of the green onion first, adding the salt, garlic, and red chili flakes (if using). Let sizzle for about a minute or two. Add the greens and let sizzle for about a minute before taking off the heat. This should be fragrant and fill your kitchen with green onion goodness. 
3. Assemble the ramen by adding the broth to a bowl, then toppings and mix-ins. Finally, top with the green onion oil. Devour.

Notes: Normally, I simmer the tofu in the broth as well, but sautéeing is also delicious. 
If you are unsure what to do with the kombu, I normally feed it to my roommate, who enjoys leaves. If you do not have such a roommate, you can rinse it and reuse it by drying then soaking before the second use. If you do not wish to go through the trouble, kombu stock powder works just as well. Or, you can omit the kombu entirely for about as good a broth.
